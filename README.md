# üßô Spellcasters

**Spellcasters** is a hackathon game challenge where participants program bots to battle in a turn-based, wizard-themed strategy arena. Each bot controls a wizard who can move, cast spells, summon minions, and collect artifacts ‚Äî all on a 10x10 battlefield.

This repo includes:
- A full game engine
- Bot development framework
- Visualizer with animations (using Pygame)
- Sample smart bots

## üéÆ How It Works

Each wizard-bot competes by:
- Moving across a grid (like a chess king)
- Casting spells (fireball, shield, teleport, etc.)
- Summoning minions
- Collecting artifacts for health, mana, or cooldown boosts

Bots receive structured game state input each turn and return an action (move + optional spell).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install pip-tools and Compile Requirements

```bash
pip install pip-tools
pip-compile requirements.in 
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run a Tournament

The `playground.py` script allows you to run tournaments between bots:

```bash
# Run a single tournament
python playground.py 1

# Run 100 tournaments and track win rates
python playground.py 100
```

By default, the script tracks win rate for the "Kevin Link" bot. You can modify the target bot name in the script.

## üß† Bot Interface

To participate in the game, each bot must implement a decide(state) method. This method is called every turn and must return an action dict.
Ask your AI assistant to give you more details.

---

## üì• State Input Format

The state dictionary includes everything your bot needs to make decisions - your AI assistant can provide you more details on this.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Add Your Own Bot

Create a new folder/module in bots/, and implement the required decide(state) logic.
Your main task is to implement how decide method works for your bot. Method needs to return an object like this:
```python
{
    "move": move,
    "spell": spell
}
```
Move must be an array of two integers where one represent your movement on x-axis and another one movement on y-axis. Numbers must be in range from -1 to 1.

Spell format is defined as below:
```python 
{
    "name": spell_name,
    "target": position
}
```
Spell name must be one of the values defined in rules.py. Position is a tuple representing coordinates on the board.

Spells shield and heal do not require target to be provided.

## ü§ñ Testing Your Bot

You can use the `playground.py` script to test your bot against others:

1. **Run a Single Tournament**:
   ```bash
   python playground.py 1
   ```
   This will run one tournament with all available bots.

2. **Run Multiple Tournaments**:
   ```bash
   python playground.py 100
   ```
   This will run 100 tournaments and calculate win rates for the target bot.

3. **Analyze Bot Performance**:
   The script outputs match results and final win rates, which you can use to analyze and improve your bot's strategy.

## üì• Add Sprites
Place custom assets in assets/:

```
assets/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wizards/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ minions/
```

Use PNGs with transparent backgrounds. Add the path to your sprite using the respective properties in the bot class.
NOTE: It is not necessary to add sprites to play the game - if the custom sprite is not provided then the default one(s) will be used.
