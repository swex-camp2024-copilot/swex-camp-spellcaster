"""TurnProcessor for collecting, validating, and preparing actions per turn (Task 7.2).

Responsibilities:
- Collect actions from players with timeout semantics
- Provide a submission API to store actions as they arrive
- Validate actions against basic constraints (extensible for full rule checks)
- Produce a complete action set for the current turn, filling in defaults for missing

Integration with the game engine (applying actions) is handled in Task 7.3.
